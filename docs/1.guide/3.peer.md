# Peer

> Peer object allows easily interacting with connected clients.

Websocket [hooks](/guide/hooks) accept a peer instance as their first argument. You can use peer object to get information about each connected client or send a message to them.

> [!TIP]
> You can safely log a peer instance to the console using `console.log` it will be automatically stringified with useful information including the remote address and connection status!

## API
