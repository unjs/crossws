# Getting Started

> crossws provides a cross-platform toolkit to define well-typed WebSocket apps that can then be integrated into various WebSocket servers using built-in adapters.

Writing a realtime WebSocket server that can work in different runtimes is challenging because there is no single standard for WebSocket servers. You often need to go into many details of different API implementations and it also makes switching from one runtime costly. crossws is a solution to this!

## Quick Start

> [!TIP]
> You can try crossws with [online playground](https://stackblitz.com/github/unjs/crossws/tree/main/examples/h3?file=app.ts) using [unjs/h3](https://h3.unjs.io) + [unjs/listhen](https://listhen.unjs.io) or alternatively integrate crossws with your own framework.

A simple WebSocket implementation looks like this:

```ts
import { defineHooks } from "crossws";
import crossws from "crossws/adapters/<adapter>";

const ws = crossws({
  hooks: {
    open(peer) {
      console.log("[ws] open", peer);
    },

    message(peer, message) {
      console.log("[ws] message", peer, message);
      if (message.text().includes("ping")) {
        peer.send("pong");
      }
    },

    close(peer, event) {
      console.log("[ws] close", peer, event);
    },

    error(peer, error) {
      console.log("[ws] error", peer, error);
    },
  },
});
```

See [Hooks](/guide/hooks) for more usage details.

::read-more{to="/adapters" title="Adapters"}
Hooks API is exactly same on all runtimes. See [Adapters](/adapters) for integration details.

## Using Package

You can install `crossws` from [npm](https://npmjs.com/crossws) in your project:

:pm-install{name="crossws"}

Alternatively you can import it from CDN:

```js
import { defineHooks } from "https://esm.sh/crossws";
import crossws from "https://esm.sh/crossws/adapters/<adapter>";
```
