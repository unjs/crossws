/**
 * Registry symbol used to hand WebSocket hooks off to crossws **on the request**.

 * crossws for *types only* (h3 keeps it an optional peer dependency and has no
 * runtime import) can write it without importing anything, and because it lives
 * in the global symbol registry it also crosses duplicate module instances and
 * realms.
 *
 * The request is used rather than the response because a `Response` is routinely
 * *rebuilt* on its way out of an app — merging a staged header, stripping a HEAD
 * body, wrapping a stream, `new Response(res.body, res)` in any middleware — and
 * a rebuilt response carries none of the original's own properties, silently
 * dropping hooks attached to it. Nothing in that chain replaces the request.
 *
 * Honored only by the default resolver of the `crossws/server` plugin; a
 * user-supplied `resolve` bypasses it entirely.
