 *   `resolve`, `undefined` is returned so those hooks run via the adapter's
 *   global-hook path with zero per-event overhead. Inline hooks and
 *   app-resolved hooks are treated as mutually exclusive modes.
 * - Otherwise a default resolver is returned that calls the server's own
 *   `fetch` handler and reads the hooks back from either channel: the
 *   `Symbol.for("crossws.hooks")` property the app attached to the **request**
 *   (see {@link getWebSocketHooks}), or the `crossws` property on the returned
 *   `Response` (the srvx convention). The request channel exists because a
 *   `Response` is routinely rebuilt on its way out of an app, which drops the
 *   hooks; see {@link kWebSocketHooks}.
 *
 * @throws if the server has no `fetch` handler to resolve hooks from.

 *
 * `reqHooks` are the hooks the app attached to the *request* instead (see

 * the result always win, and a result that would have rejected the handshake
 * still rejects it. The single exception is `426 Upgrade Required` — the status
 * a framework returns *because* it routed to a WebSocket handler (h3's
 * `defineWebSocketHandler`), so a `426` alongside request hooks is an upgrade,
 * not a rejection. Any other error/redirect status still aborts, keeping
 * auth-style rejections that run after the handler intact.
